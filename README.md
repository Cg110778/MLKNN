# MLKNN
MLKNN multi-label K-Nearest-Neighbor commited by Zhihua Zhou and Mingling Zhang,
MAP(maximum a posteriori) idea is utilized to make prediction by reasoning with the labeling information
embodied in the neighbors

I realized the mlknn by python, some errors and adjustments need done.
Hope you to give some optimized code advice.
